# flamingoapp
App which allows for easier networking at conference events.

# What is it
Flamingo tracks your location in the background which will help it to identify whether you are currently at an event like a hackathon or a conference. Then using  bluetooth, you will be able to get someone's Linkedin account without being required to type in someone's name or search several pages of LinkedIn to find them.

# How we built it
Used Objective-C to build the app and used APIs from LinkedIn while we were building the app. We also built a website using HTML, CSS and JS.
